## Mr. GPT - Discord Implementation of OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Learning Model
Mr. GPT is a Discord bot that uses OpenAI's GPT 3.5 learning model to generate text in response to user commands. The bot uses OpenAI's API, Discord's API, and JavaScript for building it. The bot can generate a wide range of responses to user inputs, making it a fun and interactive addition to any Discord server.
